I love building IT-based innovative products that impact people and revolutionize how we live in the new world. Since my polytechnic (high school), I've been taking part in innovative Competiton and Hackathon despite coming from an engineering background. I've worked with Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Cloud solution, and some DevOps operation. Outside of work, I am also working closely with my mentor to build my asset-based business. My personal vision in life is to impact people, leave a legacy and to improve my family's quality of living.
